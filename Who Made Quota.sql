-- As a data analyst on the Oracle Sales Operations team, you are given a list of salespeopleâ€™s deals, and the annual quota they need to hit.

-- Write a query that outputs each employee id and whether they hit the quota or not ('yes' or 'no'). Order the results by employee id in ascending order.

-- Definitions:

-- deal_size: Deals acquired by a salesperson in the year. Each salesperson may have more than 1 deal.
-- quota: Total annual quota for each salesperson.
-- deals Table:
-- Column Name	Type
-- employee_id	integer
-- deal_size	integer
-- deals Example Input:
-- employee_id	deal_size
-- 101	400000
-- 101	300000
-- 201	500000
-- 301	500000
-- sales_quotas Table:
-- Column Name	Type
-- employee_id	integer
-- quota	integer
-- sales_quotas Example Input:
-- employee_id	quota
-- 101	500000
-- 201	400000
-- 301	600000
-- Example Output:
-- employee_id	made_quota
-- 101	yes
-- 201	yes
-- 301	no
-- Explanation:
-- User 101 had $700k in sales, beating their $500k quota. User 201 had $500k in sales, beating their $400k quota. User 301 had $500k in sales, but had a $600k quota, so they didn't hit their goal.

-- The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
